  short: |
      NetworkManager is a set of co-operative tools that make networking simple and straightforward.
      Whether WiFi, wired, 3G, or Bluetooth, NetworkManager allows you to quickly move from one network to another:
      once a network has been configured and joined once, it can be detected and re-joined automatically the next time its available.
